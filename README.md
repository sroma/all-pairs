# all-pairs
All-pairs shortest-path problem in directed weighted graph (parallel version).

floyd-warshall.cpp - realization of Floyd-Warshall algorithm (C++/OpenMP). Graph is stored as connectively matrix.

johnson.cpp - realization of Johnson algorithm (C++/OpenMP). Deikstra algorithm is realized on arrays. Graph is stored as array of edges.

Test case: Rome graph
